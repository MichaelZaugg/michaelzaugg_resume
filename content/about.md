# About Me

I’m Michael Zaugg, a Computer Engineering student at Brigham Young University–Idaho, originally from Tillamook, Oregon.

Growing up, my family lived by the motto “If you make it.” That phrase taught me that innovation isn’t about waiting for possibilities—it’s about <mark>creating them</mark>. That mindset drives my passion for electronics, embedded systems, and aviation, and inspires me to design things that bridge imagination and engineering. At my core, I’m driven by curiosity and creativity—someone who loves to create, customize, and refine ideas into reality.
