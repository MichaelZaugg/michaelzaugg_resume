# About Me

I’m Michael Zaugg, a Computer Engineering student at Brigham Young University–Idaho, originally from Tillamook, Oregon.

Growing up, my family lived by the motto “If you make it". That phrase taught me that innovation isn’t about waiting for possibilities—it’s about <mark>creating them</mark>. That mindset drives my passion for electronics, embedded systems, aviation, and inspires me to design things that bridge imagination and engineering. At my core, I’m driven by curiosity and creativity—someone who loves to create, customize, and refine ideas into reality.

I’m also an Eagle Scout, a Student Pilot, and a former member of Civil Air Patrol. These experiences taught me leadership, discipline, and teamwork, as well as the importance of safety and precision—values that translate directly into my engineering work. They sparked my lifelong fascination with aviation and technology and continue to motivate my pursuit of systems that connect hardware and innovation.

My interests/hobbies include electronics, robotics, aviation, drone photography, CAD design, and much more. I enjoy learning new skills and technologies to bring ideas to life, especially when they involve solving real-world problems. Many of my personal projects tie directly into my coursework in computer engineering, allowing me to apply what I learn through hands-on experimentation. I’m always looking for opportunities to expand my technical abilities and take on challenges that push me to grow as an engineer.
